Notes on windows dependencies
==================================

This folder contains prebuilt dependencies needed to build and run the open-ephys software on Windows systems.

On some cases, building with the precompiles libraries might fail at link time. In this case, we recommend to build them in the same system that is going to compile the software.

Please check the Windows_ page on the wiki_ for more information.

This GUI was designed to provide a fast and flexible interface fo to do that through "The Jucer," using the "open-ephys.jucer" file. The Jucer makefiles are located in the JuceLibraryCode/jucer/Builds folder, or as part of the Juce library package on SourceForge_.
